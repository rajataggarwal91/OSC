Points to note:

 1. As we will be deficit of TIME, we need to go very very fast. So be prepared before u come.
 2. Try to understand what classes are. That will really help if you haven't used Java or C++ earlier.
 3. It will be assumed that all the participants have sufficient knowledge of atleast basic C. 
 4. It is not necessary that participants know C++ before they can go for Java but prior knowledge of C++ will definitely help.
 5. All the programs and description will be taken from THE COMPLETE REFERENCE- Herbert Schildt.
 6. Java is very vast and we will include only core Java in our seminar but it will build a platform from where you can learn new things more easily and speedily. 
 7. People interested in learning J2ME or J2EE can come directly to us during free time.
 8. Presentation material will be provided to you beforehand.
 9. if there are any queries mail them to rajataggarwal91@gmail.com
