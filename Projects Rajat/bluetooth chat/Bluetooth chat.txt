Description:
	Bluetooth messaging project sends messages between devices using Serial communication. Two devices can have two way communication between themselves (one server and one client) and then after some specified time ( 5 sec in this program) client pairs with another server. All the messages printed on client's screen are then copied to second  server screen. Two servers are used because a single client knows everytime whom to connect with. This goes on.

State of project:
	Incomplete
	functioning for three devices only. Unexpected problems occur as time of run increases.	

Direction for loading and running:
	Open the project into your netbeans IDE after copying the folder into suitable position.
	Netbeans IDE 6.8 and above run this without any problem.
	Run the program and wait for emulator to load
	Once emulator comes up, Go to project properties and change the emulator to any other bluetooth supporting 	emulator device. Then rerun. Do this another time for third emulator device.
	Now you have three device emulators on your screen.
	Enter user names in all three
	Enter device number as 0,1 and 2 on 3 different emulators
	Now you can send message from one device to another by writing into textbox
	
	The coding part is a little tricky and might require reading of Bluetooth and J2ME fundamentals beforehand.
	Some pdfs attached with the project might help you as they did to us.
